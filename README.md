# HUUGO-CHATBOT

This chatbot was built to assist with the [HUUGO Course](https://get.huugo.com/pages/program-features) content. It uses the OpenAI Chat Completion API, Django and HTML/CSS for buidling a clean and functional web app. The fine-tuned model is 'Davinci' and it is fine-tuned with Huugo's course content so it can help/give feedback on any written assignments, clear any doubts, and give general career coaching advice.
